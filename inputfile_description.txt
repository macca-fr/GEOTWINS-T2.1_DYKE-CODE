In this file is described the content of the three input files for the DYKE-CODE_GEOTWINS: input_BE.dat, input_field.dat, and the "INPUT_STRESS_FILE".dat
These input files must be located in a folder called "input", within the same directory where the DYKE-SIMULATION_GEOTWINS is executed (here you will find them in RUNS/TEST_01/input). 
The Fortran type of variable for the input parameters are given as follow:
Double precision -> [D] (1.123D0)
Integer          -> [I] (1)
Logical          -> [L] (.true./.false.)
Character String -> [S] ('string of character')

FILE: input_BE.dat
*******************************************************************************************************************
Contains parameters defining the geometry of boundary element (BE) crack, the properties of the elastic domain, and the properties of the fluid filling the crack.
The reference frame for input coordinates is with x-axis horizontal rightwards, and z-axis vertical downwards.

** Rock and fluid parameters:
MU1     -> [D] Rigidity of the lower rock layer (z>0) [MPa] or [kPa]
NU1     -> [D] Poisson's ratio of the lower rock layer (z>0)
rhoR1   -> [D] Density of the lower rock layer (z>0) [kg/dm^3]

MU2      -> [D] Rigidity of the upper rock layer (z<0) [MPa] or [kPa]. If MU2, NU2 and rhoR2 are set to zero the horizontal plane z=0 will represent the elastic free surface.
NU2      -> [D] Poisson's ratio of the upper rock layer (z<0).
rhoR2    -> [D] Density of the upper rock layer (z<0) [kg/dm^3].

z_dns    -> [D] Depth of a density transition [km] or [m]. If there's no density transition, set the same vale for z_dns and z_ref, see below.
z_ref    -> [D] Depth at which the lithostatic stress vanishes [km] or [m]. If the elastic free surface at z=0 has been set (by choosing MU2 = NU2 = rhoR2 = 0), z_ref should be set to zero as well.

rhoM     -> [D] Density of the crack filling fluid [kg/dm^3]
K        -> [D] Bulk modulus of the fluid [MPa] or [kPa]

SigXX    -> [D] Horizontal stress acting within the simulation domain. This and the following stress components are added to the lithostatic stress, which in this version of the code is isotropic, defined as: Sxx=Szz=rhoR*g*z, Sxz=Szx=0
SigZZ    -> [D] Vertical stress
mx_SXX   -> [D] Horizontal stress gradient along the x axis
mz_SXX   -> [D] Horizontal stress gradient along the z axis
mx_SZZ   -> [D] Vertical stress gradient along the x axis
mz_SZZ   -> [D] Vertical stress gradient along the z axis

n_cracks -> [I] Number of cracks for a single simulation

** If "n_cracks" > 1, provide the following 5 parameters for as many times as n_cracks (5 per row):
X_start  -> [D] x coordinate(s) of the upper tip of the crack(s) [km] or [m]. This and the following four parameters must be entered for each of the "n_cracks".
Z_start  -> [D] z coordinate(s) of the upper tip of the crack(s) [km] or [m]
A0       -> [D] Initial cross sectional area(s) occupied by the fluid at vanishing lithostatic pressure [km^2] or [m^2]. Represent the 2D equivalent to the volume of fluid filling the crack. Given the rock parameters, A0 defines the so called "critical length for propagation" (Lc) according to Weertman crack theory (Weertman 1971).
DeA0     -> [D] Cross sectional area increment [normalized between 0 and 1]. At each time step the fluid cross sectional area (2D volume) will be increased by a percent equal to DeA0 ONLY IF the crack is not able to propagate by its own (for buoyancy or internal pressure)
delta0   -> [D] Initial dip angle(s) of the crack(s), in degrees from vertical positive counterclockwise   

** if "n_cracks" > 1, the following parameters will apply to all cracks:
n_dis_in -> [I] number of dislocation elements for the BE crack (may vary during the simulation)
Hd0      -> [D] length of dislocation elements [km] or [m] (will be constant during the simulation)
** Note that the combination of n_dis_in and Hd0 define the initial length of the crack (L0). If L0>Lc (with Lc the critical length for propagation), the crack length will shorten from the bottom (therefore the number of dislocation element will decrease) until the length Lc is reached, and the propagation procedure will start; if L0<Lc, the propagation procedure will start and the crack will grow in the favourite direction of propagation (the fracture will elongate and the number of dislocation elements will increase). In this case the initial fluid-filled fracture will be additionally over-pressurized because of fluid compression within a initial fracture with length shorter than Lc.  

** Parameters defining the initial dip angle for the crack(s):
delta_optimal -> [L] If .true. the dip angle will be perpendicular to sig3 (optimally oriented for tensile opening), if .false. the initial dip angle will be delta0.

** Parameters defining the crack propagation procedure:
n_iter                           -> [I] maximum number of "simulation steps": at each simulation step the crack either propagates (by adding a dislocation element, if the propagation condition is met), or increase the cross sectional area (2D volume), in order to increase the internal pressure and get closer to the propagation condition.
n_dir                            -> [I] number of direction of propagation that will be tested at each propagation step
alfa                             -> [D] angle between each of the tested direction of propagation [degrees]
x_stop_min / x_stop_max / z_stop -> [D] left / right / upper boundaries of the propagation domain (the simulation will stop if the crack reaches one of these boundaries)
E_prop                           -> [D] energy threshold for crack propagation [MPa*m] or [kPa*mm]

FILE: input_field.dat
*******************************************************************************************************************
Contains parameters related with the input stress field file (external stress acting in the elastic domain), and output files (crack shape, stress and displacement fields induced by the crack in the elastic domain, principal stress directions of the input stress file).
The following parameters will have to be provided in the input_field.dat file:

** input stress field (see also the description for the FILE 'INPUT_STRESS_FILE.dat'):
input_stress                  -> [S] file name and path of the input stress file (example: './input/null_stress_field.dat')
x_min / x_max / z_min / z_max -> [D] spatial domain for the input stress file [km] or [m] (will also define the output domain for the calculation of stress and displacement fields induced by the crack)
grd_1                         -> [D] grid step for the input stress file [km] or [m]

** output stress and displacement fields (the domain for the calculation of output fields is defined by the domain of the input stress):
Dz_snap           -> [D] z-interval for printing the output files for crack stress, displacement, and shapes [km] or [m]. These output files are not printed at each propagation step, they will be printed each time the crack tip reaches a depth z=n*Dz_snap, with n integer (and z>z_stop).
comp_crack_stress -> [L] Enter .true. for printing the output files with the stress and displacement fields induced by the crack in the elastic domain (they will be printed every "Dz_snap" interval)
crackRF_optimal   -> [L] Enter .true. to get the output stress field in a reference frame with z parallel to the average dip angle of the crack; .false. for the output stress field on a reference frame with z vertical (output files: xzSxxSxzSzz_rXX_iXXX.dat)
out_res           -> [D] spatial resolution for output stress and displ calculation [km] or [m] (output files: xzSxxSxzSzz_rXX_iXXX.dat and xzUxUz_rXX_iXXX.dat)
grd_2             -> [D] grid step for the output-files containing the directions of principal stress given by the input stress [km] or [m] (output files: inplane_max[min]_compr_stress.dat)

** crack shape:
scl -> [D] Scaling factor for plotting the crack shape. It exaggerates the crack opening and slip by the given value (output files: crack_shape_rXX_iXXX.dat)

*******************************************************************************************************************
FILE: 'INPUT_STRESS_FILE.dat' (actual name defined by 'input_stress' parameter in the 'input_field.dat' file)
*******************************************************************************************************************
Contains the stress components for the input stress field (i.e. external or background stress), acting in the elastic domain.
The input stress must be defined on a regular grid.
The reference frame must be with x-axis horizontal rightwards, and z-axis vertical downwards. The free surface (if included in the input stress domain) must be in z=0.
The number of lines must be equal to the number of nodes (N) of the regular grid, so that N=[(x_max-x_min)/grd_1 + 1]*[(z_max-z_min)/grd_1 + 1].
The number of columns must be 5: x, z, Sxx, Szz, Sxz (coordinates in [km] or [m] and stress components in [MPa] or [kPa]).

The first line must refer to the grid point in the lower-left corner of the input stress domain, the last line refer to the upper-right corner. The grid points in the input stress file must be ordered from the first (lower-left corner) to the last (upper-right corner) moving along x (from left to right) and then along z (from bottom to top).

If we number the grid points from 1 to N=Nx*Nz, where:
Nx=(x_max-x_min)/grd_1 + 1 (number of nodes along x)
Nz=(z_max-z_min)/grd_1 + 1 (number of nodes along z)

We can represent the indexes relative to the grid points for the input stress as: 
(Nz-1)*Nx+1 -> (Nz-1)*Nx+2 -> [...] -> Nz*Nx
      [...] ->       [...] -> [...] -> [...]
     2*Nx+1 ->      2*Nx+2 -> [...] ->  3*Nx
       Nx+1 ->        Nx+2 -> [...] ->  2*Nx
          1 ->           2 -> [...] ->    Nx

where the index of each node represent the line number at which the corresponding node appear in the input file.
